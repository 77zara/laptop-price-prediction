## 📌 Project Overview
Buying a laptop can be confusing with so many specifications. This project analyzes a dataset of laptops to understand how different features (RAM, CPU, GPU, etc.) influence the **Price (Euro)**.

The goal is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and build a machine learning model to **predict laptop prices** based on their specifications.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains details of varying laptop configurations:
- **Brand & Model:** `Company`, `Product`, `TypeName` (Ultrabook, Gaming, etc.)
- **Screen:** `Inches`, `ScreenResolution`
- **Performance:** `CPU_Company`, `CPU_Type`, `CPU_Frequency (GHz)`, `RAM (GB)`
- **Graphics & Memory:** `GPU_Company`, `GPU_Type`, `Memory`
- **Other:** `OpSys` (OS), `Weight (kg)`, `Price (Euro)`

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Data Cleaning:** Pandas, NumPy (Handling messy strings like '8GB', '1.2kg')
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn (Price distribution among brands, correlation heatmaps)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Regression models)

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Analyzed which components (e.g., RAM size, Gaming capability) drive the price up the most.
- Compared price performance across different brands (Apple, Dell, Lenovo, etc.).
